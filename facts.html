            Kolkata, 'The City of Joy', formerly known as Calcutta, is one of
            India's largest cities. The city is housed on the east bank of the
            Hugli (Hooghly) River, which was once the main channel of the Ganges
            (Ganga) River, about 96 miles (154 km) upstream from the head of the
            Bay of Bengal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kolkata wasn’t always known as Kolkata. Before 2001, the city was
            officially called Calcutta – the anglicised version of its name.
            Here we look at the political and cultural context surrounding the
            renaming of one of India’s largest cities. There are a number of
            reasons why Calcutta changed its name to Kolkata. Firstly, the city
            has always been pronounced Kolkata by the Bengalis. It was also felt
            that the anglicised version was simply outdated, as the country has
            been free from colonial rule for more than half a century.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The name change is also a nod to the origins of the city: Kolkata is
            said to resemble Kôlikata, the name of one of the three villages
            that originally existed on the site. The name of that village and
            present day Kolkata are derived from the Bengali word kilkila, which
            means flat area. The name is also thought to have its roots in koli
            chun, which is Bengali for quicklime and kata, which means coir, two
            products produced in the area.

              <h4>Writers’ Building</h4>
              <p>
                On December 8, 1930, the trio of Benoy, Badal and Dinesh headed
                to the building and assassinated the then inspector general of
                police, colonel Simpson who was known for treating Indian
                prisoners brutally. It is believed that the soul of Colonel
                Simpson has been haunting this place ever since he was shot by
                the three young revolutionaries. Visitors often complain about
                hearing the sounds of footsteps, giggling and random outcries,
                it is also said that no employee or worker here takes the risk
                to stay past dusk. The fifth block of the building, where
                Simpson was shot dead, is today the least visited area in the
                building.

              <h4>The Hastings House</h4>
              <p>
                The Hastings House, located in Alipore, was built by the then
                Governor-General Warren Hastings for himself and today is a
                well-known women’s college. The students of the college have
                often claimed to have seen a man, believed to be Warren
                Hastings, riding on a horse and seemingly searching for
                something. It is said that Hastings towards the later years of
                his life, was extremely depressed and sad. Many believe that his
                soul never really found peace and is still in search of it. Some
                also claim to hear giggles of a young boy and the sound of a
                football late at midnight, when the college is vacant.

                Ever tried boarding the last train at Rabindra Sarobar Station?
                You probably shouldn’t! According to numerous passengers, they
                often see shadows and hear weird noises that have no
                explanation. It is said that all those who committed suicide at
                the station or jumped off a moving train, still haunt its
                premises and try and show their presence.

              <h4>The National Library</h4>
              <p>
                Built in 1836, The National Library at Belvedere Estate is known
                for two things, its rare collection of books and its not so rare
                incidents of paranormal activities. The guards of the premises
                often complain about hearing random sounds of a woman, perhaps
                the wife of Lord Metcalfe who was a stickler for cleanliness,
                howling and sometimes giggling as well. If you do not keep the
                book you’re reading back where you took it from, you can feel
                her breathing heavily down your neck. It is also said that in
                2010, when the building was renovated, around 12 men died
                brutally on the renovation sight and the souls of those men
                still haunt the National Library at night.

                One of the most touristy spots in Kolkata, the South Park
                Cemetery will definitely give you chills. Most of the graves
                here belong to British soldiers. Despite the fact that may have
                felt the presence of certain forces here, the spirits haven’t
                seemed to harm many. Except for once, when a group of friends
                noticed the presence of a weird shadow in all the photographs
                they clicked there and the boy who clicked the photo died of an
                asthma attack even though he wasn’t asthmatic!
